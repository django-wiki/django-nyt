How to map a related object to a notification
=============================================

Since django-nyt is based on Django, we encourage you to extend functionality by writing your own models.

A common scenario is when you want to provide extra data with a notification.
Typically, users are notified about a specific object being created or updated.
You can keep this relation by writing your own relational model.

For instance, if we want to track that a notification is for a specific Comment,
we can store this relation in such a model:

.. code-block:: python

   class CommentNotification(models.Model):
    notification = models.OneToOneField(
        "django_nyt.Notification",
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="comment",
    )
    comment = models.ForeignKey(
        Comment,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )

Then we can plugin a Django signal to create the notification and store the new relation:

.. code-block:: python

    @receiver(post_save, sender=Comment)
    def event_published(**kwargs):
        comment = kwargs.get("comment")

        # Notify everyone except for the comment author (they know!)
        notifications = notify(
            f"Comment created {comment.title}",
            key=COMMENT_CREATED,
            url=reverse("comments:comment_detail", kwargs={"pk": comments.id}),
            filter_exclude={"settings__user": comment.author},
        )
        for notification in notifications:
            models.CommentNotification.objects.create(
                notification=notification,
                comment=comment,
            )

After this, we can access the comment related to a notifications.
For instance, if we have defined a custom template for the ``COMMENT_CREATED`` key,
we could send out an email to a moderator and display the whole comment text in the email.
Emails generated by django-nyt all receive their notifications in the template context,
and therefore accessing the comments can be done with ``notification.comment`` (defined by the reverse relation on the ``OneToOneField``.)
