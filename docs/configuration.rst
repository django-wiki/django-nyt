Configuration
=============

These are the settings from ``django_nyt.settings`` that can be overridden from
your project settings.

To override a setting, prefix the name of that setting with ``NYT_``. For instance,
to override ``EMAIL_SENDER``, set the value of ``NYT_EMAIL_SENDER`` in your
project's settings.

.. automodule:: django_nyt.settings
